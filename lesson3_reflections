Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your changes with everbody 
when you watn to keep your changes in the cloud

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

Because I want to have the control of when I do commit the changes.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?


A clone is when you download the repository that is in the cloud to your computer.
A branch is when you copy thorougt git the current state of a working copy.
And a fork happens on the cloud when you copy a repository from another person.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Well the only thing that comes to my mind is that you can compare against that in any momment
lests say before commiting.
