Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is a temporary storage of your work
it is no the repo cause just you can see your own changes
it is not the working copy cause some of the current changes in your working copy should not be committed.

you can revert somehow that change and not commit it.
